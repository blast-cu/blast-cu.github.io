### About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/), where I lead the [Boulder Language and Social Technologies](https://blast-cu.github.io/) research group. I am also a Faculty Fellow at CU's [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/).

Before joining CU, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research
NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), and my BSc. in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Universidad Simon Bolivar](http://www.usb.ve/) in Caracas, Venezuela, where I was born and raised.

### My Work

I primarily work on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Computational Social Science. I am mostly interested in the integration of structured knowledge and statistical models, and in the relationship between language and social systems. I am a strong believer in interdisciplinary, collaborative work. I actively collaborate with researchers in linguistics, human-computer interaction, formal methods, security, bioinformatics, and the behavioral and social sciences.
