Welcome to the webpage of the Boulder Language and Social Technologies research group (BLAST). We are based in the [Department of Computer
Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/).

At BLAST we work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and
Computational Social Science. We aim to address societally relevant problems through the computational analysis of language. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:

* Explainable, knowledge-infused NLP methods (e.g. structured
prediction, relational learning and neuro-symbolic methods)
* Interactive and human-in-the-loop learning for NLP
* Discourse, pragmatics and argumentation
* Narrative modeling and understanding
* Text as data; the study of social and cultural phenomena through the
computational analysis of language
