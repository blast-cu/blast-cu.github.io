Welcome to the webpage of the Boulder Language and Social Technologies research group (BLAST). We are based in the [Department of Computer
Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/).

At BLAST we work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and
Computational Social Science. We are passionate about developing NLP systems that
can effecitively support research in other disciplines. Similarly, we are interested in using NLP methods to study
social and cultural phenomena. To this purpose, we maintain a research
agenda that balances methods and applications. We strongly believe in
interdisciplinary, collaborative work, and actively collaborate with
researchers in linguistics, security, human-computer interaction, and
the behavioral and social sciences. Some of our current areas of interest are:

* Explainable, knowledge-infused NLP methods (e.g. structured
prediction, relational learning and neuro-symbolic methods)
* Interactive and human-in-the-loop learning for NLP
* Discourse analysis and argument mining
* Narrative modeling and understanding
* Text as data: the study of social and cultural phenomena through the
computational analysis of language
