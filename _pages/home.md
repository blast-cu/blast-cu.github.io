Welcome to the webpage of the Boulder Language and Social Technologies research group (BLAST), led by [Prof. Maria L. Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/). 

We are based in the [Department of Computer
Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/).

At BLAST we work on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and
Computational Social Science. We are broadly interested in finding transparent and replicable insights to societally relevant problems through the computational analysis of language. In general, we are curious about:
* What **language use** can tell us about **culture** and **society**.
* **Analyzing content at scale** in traditional and emerging media, and grounding our findings in relevant **theory**
* Applications of **NLP** for **human factors** and **socio-technical systems**: e.g., science communication and discovery, education, collaboration, safety, accessibility, fairness
* Incorporating a **cross-disciplinary lens** to our research whenever appropriate
* Studying and developing **computational methods** and **tools** that facilitate all of the above

To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and applications. Our ongoing project span the following areas:

* Explainable and knowledge-infused ML methods (e.g. structured
prediction, relational learning and neuro-symbolic methods) and their applicability to NLP.
* Discourse and pragmatics
* Narrative modeling and understanding
* Rhetoric and argumentation
* NLP for human-computer interaction, education and computational social science.
