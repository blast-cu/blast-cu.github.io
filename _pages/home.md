Welcome to the webpage of the Boulder Language and Social Technologies research group (BLAST). We are based in the [Department of Computer
Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/).

At BLAST we work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Social Computing and
Computational Social Science. We aim to address societally relevant problems through the computational analysis of language. Our main goal is to study and develop computational systems to support communication and cooperation between humans, as well as facilitating the large-scale processing of information to produce and advance knowledge. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:

* Explainable and knowledge-infused methods for NLP (e.g. structured
prediction, relational learning and neuro-symbolic methods)
* NLP for human-computer interaction and social computing
* Discourse, pragmatics and argumentation
* Narrative modeling and understanding
* Language as data; the study of social and cultural phenomena through the
computational analysis of language
