Welcome to the webpage of the Boulder Language and Social Technologies research group (BLAST). We are based in the [Department of Computer
Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/).

At BLAST we work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Social Computing and
Computational Social Science. We aim to address societally relevant problems through the computational analysis of language. Our broad mission is: (1) Studying and developing computational systems that can effectively support communication and cooperation between humans, as well as between humans and computer systems and (2) Facilitating the large-scale analysis of language and information to produce and advance knowledge. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:

* Explainable and knowledge-infused ML methods (e.g. structured
prediction, relational learning and neuro-symbolic methods) and their applicability to NLP. 
* Discourse, pragmatics and argumentation
* Narrative modeling and understanding
* NLP for human-computer interaction, education and computational social science.
